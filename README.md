# CIVIL-LAB---EXCEL

Civil-lab is an open-source program system aiming at simplifying the work for civil-engineering （maybe also other practices）

I am a civil engineer, well a lazy one. Thus I do not want to spend time to repeat my works with computers. I came up with the idea of developing the Add-in of "Civil-Lab" to automation the works of calculation. It works quite well, thus I would like to publish it to benefit others as well and my programming skills as well as my time are still limited, it is still welcome if you want to join the project to together develop it.

Under the whole project "CIVIL-LAB" there are currently two parts. The first EXCEL add-in and the ABAQUS add-in. The Excel part is developed with the EXCEL-VBA language. Why EXCEL？ I know nowadays other programming languages such as Python or Matlab is more favorable by the researchers, however, excel is still the most used program, almost all the windows based computer has it installed. If you want to develop a small calculation program, For sure Excel can be very efficient. However for some tasks, for example, to add units can be still difficult. With "CIVIL-LAB" the work can be much easier.

"CIVIL—LAB-EXCEL" is an Excel Add-in, which can help accelerate the engineering practice. It can do general tasks such as the formating, add units, draw cross-sections. It adds new general functions such as the functions for table interpolation for the advanced copy. It builds the engineering tables inside such as the steel profile information, material information by codes. It contains the function of Eurocodes design, thus you do not need to type in it again, instead, you can just type in the function name. Many new features are also expected and maybe added by you.

Hope the program can help you as well！
